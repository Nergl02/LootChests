# ðŸ§  How much weight each rarity gets in loot distribution (must total 100%)
rarity-pools:
  COMMON: 60        # 60% of filled items should be from COMMON pool
  UNCOMMON: 25      # 25% of items should be from UNCOMMON
  RARE: 10          # 10% from RARE
  EPIC: 4           # 4% from EPIC
  LEGENDARY: 1      # 1% from LEGENDARY

# ðŸŽ¯ This ratio will guide how many items are chosen per rarity tier
# Example: If 5 items are to be selected, and RARE has 10%, then ~0.5 (rounded up/down) will come from RARE pool
